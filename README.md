Translator
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contao-community-alliance/translator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/contao-community-alliance/translator)

The Contao Community Alliance translation library allows easy use of various translation string sources.

It ships with a collection of various translation string providers:

* Static values that get populated during runtime by code (StaticTranslator).
* Adapter for [Contao CMS](https://github.com/contao/core) language string arrays (LangArrayTranslator).

In addition it also provides a translator chain using which various translators can be stacked.

Known limitations:
------------------

* We have no manual so far. Bummer! :/
* We have not tested it all yet, so please give it a try yourself.
